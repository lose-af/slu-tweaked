> Original mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-souls-like-universe

Modified and used by Losenone Minecraft Server.

## Changes

- Every spawnable entity will despawn when idle.
- Decrease field boss spawn chances.
- Smaller boss tick range (64 -> 32).

hello, every one! I can no longer develop this mod for time reasons.

So I share the workspace file of the mcreator program.
Feel free to develop the second round!
